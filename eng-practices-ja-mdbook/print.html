<p>Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and
all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various
best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source
projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to
make it available publicly when possible.</p>
<p>Currently this contains the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="review/index.html">Google's Code Review Guidelines</a>, which are actually two
separate sets of documents:
<ul>
<li><a href="review/reviewer/index.html">The Code Reviewer's Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="review/developer/index.html">The Change Author's Guide</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>There is some Google-internal terminology used in some of these documents, which
we clarify here for external readers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CL</strong>: Stands for "changelist", which means one self-contained change that
has been submitted to version control or which is undergoing code review.
Other organizations often call this a "change", "patch", or "pull-request".</li>
<li><strong>LGTM</strong>: Means "Looks Good to Me". It is what a code reviewer says when
approving a CL.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="intro"><a class="header" href="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>A code review is a process where someone other than the author(s) of a piece of
code examines that code.</p>
<p>At Google, we use code review to maintain the quality of our code and products.</p>
<p>This documentation is the canonical description of Google's code review
processes and policies.</p>
<p>This page is an overview of our code review process. There are two other large
documents that are a part of this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="review/reviewer/index.html">How To Do A Code Review</a></strong>: A detailed guide for code
reviewers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="review/developer/index.html">The CL Author's Guide</a></strong>: A detailed guide for
developers whose CLs are going through review.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="look_for"><a class="header" href="#look_for">What Do Code Reviewers Look For?</a></h2>
<p>Code reviews should look at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?</li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is
the way the code behaves good for its users?</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be
able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the
future?</li>
<li><strong>Tests</strong>: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?</li>
<li><strong>Naming</strong>: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes,
methods, etc.?</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Are the comments clear and useful?</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Does the code follow our
<a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/">style guides</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?</li>
</ul>
<p>See <strong><a href="review/reviewer/index.html">How To Do A Code Review</a></strong> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="best_reviewers"><a class="header" href="#best_reviewers">Picking the Best Reviewers</a></h3>
<p>In general, you want to find the <em>best</em> reviewers you can who are capable of
responding to your review within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>The best reviewer is the person who will be able to give you the most thorough
and correct review for the piece of code you are writing. This usually means the
owner(s) of the code, who may or may not be the people in the OWNERS file.
Sometimes this means asking different people to review different parts of the
CL.</p>
<p>If you find an ideal reviewer but they are not available, you should at least CC
them on your change.</p>
<h3 id="in_person"><a class="header" href="#in_person">In-Person Reviews (and Pair Programming)</a></h3>
<p>If you pair-programmed a piece of code with somebody who was qualified to do a
good code review on it, then that code is considered reviewed.</p>
<p>You can also do in-person code reviews where the reviewer asks questions and the
developer of the change speaks only when spoken to.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing-good-cl-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#writing-good-cl-descriptions">Writing good CL descriptions</a></h1>
<p>A CL description is a public record of <strong>what</strong> change is being made and <strong>why</strong>
it was made. It will become a permanent part of our version control history, and
will possibly be read by hundreds of people other than your reviewers over the
years.</p>
<p>Future developers will search for your CL based on its description. Someone in
the future might be looking for your change because of a faint memory of its
relevance but without the specifics handy. If all the important information is
in the code and not the description, it's going to be a lot harder for them to
locate your CL.</p>
<h2 id="firstline"><a class="header" href="#firstline">First Line</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Short summary of what is being done.</li>
<li>Complete sentence, written as though it was an order.</li>
<li>Follow by empty line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>first line</strong> of a CL description should be a short summary of
<em>specifically</em> <strong>what</strong> <em>is being done by the CL</em>, followed by a blank line.
This is what appears in version control history summaries, so it should be
informative enough that future code searchers don't have to read your CL or its
whole description to understand what your CL actually <em>did</em> or how it differs
from other CLs. That is, the first line should stand alone, allowing readers to
skim through code history much faster.</p>
<p>Try to keep your first line short, focused, and to the point. The clarity and
utility to the reader should be the top concern.</p>
<p>By tradition, the first line of a CL description is a complete sentence, written
as though it were an order (an imperative sentence). For example, say
"<strong>Delete</strong> the FizzBuzz RPC and <strong>replace</strong> it with the new system." instead
of "<strong>Deleting</strong> the FizzBuzz RPC and <strong>replacing</strong> it with the new system."
You don't have to write the rest of the description as an imperative sentence,
though.</p>
<h2 id="informative"><a class="header" href="#informative">Body is Informative</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="review/developer/cl-descriptions.html#firstline">first line</a> should be a short, focused summary, while the rest
of the description should fill in the details and include any supplemental
information a reader needs to understand the changelist holistically. It might
include a brief description of the problem that's being solved, and why this is
the best approach. If there are any shortcomings to the approach, they should be
mentioned. If relevant, include background information such as bug numbers,
benchmark results, and links to design documents.</p>
<p>If you include links to external resources consider that they may not be visible
to future readers due to access restrictions or retention policies. Where
possible include enough context for reviewers and future readers to understand
the CL.</p>
<p>Even small CLs deserve a little attention to detail. Put the CL in context.</p>
<h2 id="bad"><a class="header" href="#bad">Bad CL Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>"Fix bug" is an inadequate CL description. What bug? What did you do to fix it?
Other similarly bad descriptions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Fix build."</li>
<li>"Add patch."</li>
<li>"Moving code from A to B."</li>
<li>"Phase 1."</li>
<li>"Add convenience functions."</li>
<li>"kill weird URLs."</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those are real CL descriptions. Although short, they do not provide
enough useful information.</p>
<h2 id="good"><a class="header" href="#good">Good CL Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>Here are some examples of good descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="functionality-change"><a class="header" href="#functionality-change">Functionality change</a></h3>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RPC: Remove size limit on RPC server message freelist.</p>
<p>Servers like FizzBuzz have very large messages and would benefit from reuse.
Make the freelist larger, and add a goroutine that frees the freelist entries
slowly over time, so that idle servers eventually release all freelist
entries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first few words describe what the CL actually does. The rest of the
description talks about the problem being solved, why this is a good solution,
and a bit more information about the specific implementation.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring"><a class="header" href="#refactoring">Refactoring</a></h3>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct a Task with a TimeKeeper to use its TimeStr and Now methods.</p>
<p>Add a Now method to Task, so the borglet() getter method can be removed (which
was only used by OOMCandidate to call borglet's Now method). This replaces the
methods on Borglet that delegate to a TimeKeeper.</p>
<p>Allowing Tasks to supply Now is a step toward eliminating the dependency on
Borglet. Eventually, collaborators that depend on getting Now from the Task
should be changed to use a TimeKeeper directly, but this has been an
accommodation to refactoring in small steps.</p>
<p>Continuing the long-range goal of refactoring the Borglet Hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line describes what the CL does and how this is a change from the
past. The rest of the description talks about the specific implementation, the
context of the CL, that the solution isn't ideal, and possible future direction.
It also explains <em>why</em> this change is being made.</p>
<h3 id="small-cl-that-needs-some-context"><a class="header" href="#small-cl-that-needs-some-context">Small CL that needs some context</a></h3>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a Python3 build rule for status.py.</p>
<p>This allows consumers who are already using this as in Python3 to depend on a
rule that is next to the original status build rule instead of somewhere in
their own tree. It encourages new consumers to use Python3 if they can,
instead of Python2, and significantly simplifies some automated build file
refactoring tools being worked on currently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence describes what's actually being done. The rest of the
description explains <em>why</em> the change is being made and gives the reviewer a lot
of context.</p>
<h2 id="tags"><a class="header" href="#tags">Using tags</a></h2>
<p>Tags are manually entered labels that can be used to categorize CLs. These may
be supported by tools or just used by team convention.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"[tag]"</li>
<li>"[a longer tag]"</li>
<li>"#tag"</li>
<li>"tag:"</li>
</ul>
<p>Using tags is optional.</p>
<p>When adding tags, consider whether they should be in the <a href="review/developer/cl-descriptions.html#informative">body</a> of
the CL description or the <a href="review/developer/cl-descriptions.html#firstline">first line</a>. Limit the usage of tags in
the first line, as this can obscure the content.</p>
<p>Examples with and without tags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.good}">// Tags are okay in the first line if kept short.
[banana] Peel the banana before eating.

// Tags can be inlined in content.
Peel the #banana before eating.

// Tags are optional.
Peel the banana before eating.

// Multiple tags are acceptable if kept short.
#banana #apple: Assemble a fruit basket.

// Tags can go anywhere in the CL description.
&gt; Assemble a fruit basket.
&gt;
&gt; #banana #apple
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-{.bad}">// Too many tags (or tags that are too long) overwhelm the first line.
//
// Instead, consider whether the tags can be moved into the description body
// and/or shortened.
[banana peeler factory factory][apple picking service] Assemble a fruit basket.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="generated-cl-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#generated-cl-descriptions">Generated CL descriptions</a></h2>
<p>Some CLs are generated by tools. Whenever possible, their descriptions should
also follow the advice here. That is, their first line should be short, focused,
and stand alone, and the CL description body should include informative details
that help reviewers and future code searchers understand each CL's effect.</p>
<h2 id="review-the-description-before-submitting-the-cl"><a class="header" href="#review-the-description-before-submitting-the-cl">Review the description before submitting the CL</a></h2>
<p>CLs can undergo significant change during review. It can be worthwhile to review
a CL description before submitting the CL, to ensure that the description still
reflects what the CL does.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="review/developer/small-cls.html">Small CLs</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="small-cls"><a class="header" href="#small-cls">Small CLs</a></h1>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why Write Small CLs?</a></h2>
<p>Small, simple CLs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviewed more quickly.</strong> It's easier for a reviewer to find five minutes
several times to review small CLs than to set aside a 30 minute block to
review one large CL.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewed more thoroughly.</strong> With large changes, reviewers and authors tend
to get frustrated by large volumes of detailed commentary shifting back and
forth—sometimes to the point where important points get missed or dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Less likely to introduce bugs.</strong> Since you're making fewer changes, it's
easier for you and your reviewer to reason effectively about the impact of
the CL and see if a bug has been introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Less wasted work if they are rejected.</strong> If you write a huge CL and then
your reviewer says that the overall direction is wrong, you've wasted a lot
of work.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to merge.</strong> Working on a large CL takes a long time, so you will
have lots of conflicts when you merge, and you will have to merge
frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to design well.</strong> It's a lot easier to polish the design and code
health of a small change than it is to refine all the details of a large
change.</li>
<li><strong>Less blocking on reviews.</strong> Sending self-contained portions of your
overall change allows you to continue coding while you wait for your current
CL in review.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler to roll back.</strong> A large CL will more likely touch files that get
updated between the initial CL submission and a rollback CL, complicating
the rollback (the intermediate CLs will probably need to be rolled back
too).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <strong>reviewers have discretion to reject your change outright for the
sole reason of it being too large.</strong> Usually they will thank you for your
contribution but request that you somehow make it into a series of smaller
changes. It can be a lot of work to split up a change after you've already
written it, or require lots of time arguing about why the reviewer should accept
your large change. It's easier to just write small CLs in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="what_is_small"><a class="header" href="#what_is_small">What is Small?</a></h2>
<p>In general, the right size for a CL is <strong>one self-contained change</strong>. This means
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CL makes a minimal change that addresses <strong>just one thing</strong>. This is
usually just one part of a feature, rather than a whole feature at once. In
general it's better to err on the side of writing CLs that are too small vs.
CLs that are too large. Work with your reviewer to find out what an
acceptable size is.</li>
<li>The CL should <a href="review/developer/small-cls.html#test_code">include related test code</a>.</li>
<li>Everything the reviewer needs to understand about the CL (except future
development) is in the CL, the CL's description, the existing codebase, or a
CL they've already reviewed.</li>
<li>The system will continue to work well for its users and for the developers
after the CL is checked in.</li>
<li>The CL is not so small that its implications are difficult to understand. If
you add a new API, you should include a usage of the API in the same CL so
that reviewers can better understand how the API will be used. This also
prevents checking in unused APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules about how large is "too large." 100 lines is
usually a reasonable size for a CL, and 1000 lines is usually too large, but
it's up to the judgment of your reviewer. The number of files that a change is
spread across also affects its "size." A 200-line change in one file might be
okay, but spread across 50 files it would usually be too large.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that although you have been intimately involved with your code from
the moment you started to write it, the reviewer often has no context. What
seems like an acceptably-sized CL to you might be overwhelming to your reviewer.
When in doubt, write CLs that are smaller than you think you need to write.
Reviewers rarely complain about getting CLs that are too small.</p>
<h2 id="large_okay"><a class="header" href="#large_okay">When are Large CLs Okay?</a></h2>
<p>There are a few situations in which large changes aren't as bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can usually count deletion of an entire file as being just one line of
change, because it doesn't take the reviewer very long to review.</li>
<li>Sometimes a large CL has been generated by an automatic refactoring tool
that you trust completely, and the reviewer's job is just to verify and say
that they really do want the change. These CLs can be larger, although some
of the caveats from above (such as merging and testing) still apply.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="efficiently"><a class="header" href="#efficiently">Writing Small CLs Efficiently</a></h2>
<p>If you write a small CL and then you wait for your reviewer to approve it before
you write your next CL, then you're going to waste a lot of time. So you want to
find some way to work that won't block you while you're waiting for review. This
could involve having multiple projects to work on simultaneously, finding
reviewers who agree to be immediately available, doing in-person reviews, pair
programming, or splitting your CLs in a way that allows you to continue working
immediately.</p>
<h2 id="splitting"><a class="header" href="#splitting">Splitting CLs</a></h2>
<p>When starting work that will have multiple CLs with potential dependencies among
each other, it's often useful to think about how to split and organize those CLs
at a high level before diving into coding.</p>
<p>Besides making things easier for you as an author to manage and organize your
CLs, it also makes things easier for your code reviewers, which in turn makes
your code reviews more efficient.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies for splitting work into different CLs.</p>
<h3 id="stacking"><a class="header" href="#stacking">Stacking Multiple Changes on Top of Each Other</a></h3>
<p>One way to split up a CL without blocking yourself is to write one small CL,
send it off for review, and then immediately start writing another CL <em>based</em> on
the first CL. Most version control systems allow you to do this somehow.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-files"><a class="header" href="#splitting-files">Splitting by Files</a></h3>
<p>Another way to split up a CL is by groupings of files that will require
different reviewers but are otherwise self-contained changes.</p>
<p>For example: you send off one CL for modifications to a protocol buffer and
another CL for changes to the code that uses that proto. You have to submit the
proto CL before the code CL, but they can both be reviewed simultaneously. If
you do this, you might want to inform both sets of reviewers about the other CL
that you wrote, so that they have context for your changes.</p>
<p>Another example: you send one CL for a code change and another for the
configuration or experiment that uses that code; this is easier to roll back
too, if necessary, as configuration/experiment files are sometimes pushed to
production faster than code changes.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-horizontally"><a class="header" href="#splitting-horizontally">Splitting Horizontally</a></h3>
<p>Consider creating shared code or stubs that help isolate changes between layers
of the tech stack. This not only helps expedite development but also encourages
abstraction between layers.</p>
<p>For example: You created a calculator app with client, API, service, and data
model layers. A shared proto signature can abstract the service and data model
layers from each other. Similarly, an API stub can split the implementation of
client code from service code and enable them to move forward independently.
Similar ideas can also be applied to more granular function or class level
abstractions.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-vertically"><a class="header" href="#splitting-vertically">Splitting Vertically</a></h3>
<p>Orthogonal to the layered, horizontal approach, you can instead break down your
code into smaller, full-stack, vertical features. Each of these features can be
independent parallel implementation tracks. This enables some tracks to move
forward while other tracks are awaiting review or feedback.</p>
<p>Back to our calculator example from
<a href="review/developer/small-cls.html#splitting-horizontally">Splitting Horizontally</a>. You now want to support new
operators, like multiplication and division. You could split this up by
implementing multiplication and division as separate verticals or sub-features,
even though they may have some overlap such as shared button styling or shared
validation logic.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-grid"><a class="header" href="#splitting-grid">Splitting Horizontally &amp; Vertically</a></h3>
<p>To take this a step further, you could combine these approaches and chart out an
implementation plan like this, where each cell is its own standalone CL.
Starting from the model (at the bottom) and working up to the client:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Layer</th><th>Feature: Multiplication</th><th>Feature: Division</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Client</td><td>Add button</td><td>Add button</td></tr>
<tr><td>API</td><td>Add endpoint</td><td>Add endpoint</td></tr>
<tr><td>Service</td><td>Implement transformations</td><td>Share transformation logic with</td></tr>
<tr><td>:         :                           : multiplication                  :</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>Add proto definition</td><td>Add proto definition</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h2 id="refactoring"><a class="header" href="#refactoring">Separate Out Refactorings</a></h2>
<p>It's usually best to do refactorings in a separate CL from feature changes or
bug fixes. For example, moving and renaming a class should be in a different CL
from fixing a bug in that class. It is much easier for reviewers to understand
the changes introduced by each CL when they are separate.</p>
<p>Small cleanups such as fixing a local variable name can be included inside of a
feature change or bug fix CL, though. It's up to the judgment of developers and
reviewers to decide when a refactoring is so large that it will make the review
more difficult if included in your current CL.</p>
<h2 id="test_code"><a class="header" href="#test_code">Keep related test code in the same CL</a></h2>
<p>CLs should include related test code. Remember that <a href="review/developer/small-cls.html#what_is_small">smallness</a>
here refers the conceptual idea that the CL should be focused and is not a
simplistic function on line count.</p>
<p>Tests are expected for all Google changes.</p>
<p>A CL that adds or changes logic should be accompanied by new or updated tests
for the new behavior. Pure refactoring CLs (that aren't intended to change
behavior) should also be covered by tests; ideally, these tests already exist,
but if they don't, you should add them.</p>
<p><em>Independent</em> test modifications can go into separate CLs first, similar to the
<a href="review/developer/small-cls.html#refactoring">refactorings guidelines</a>. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validating pre-existing, submitted code with new tests.
<ul>
<li>Ensures that important logic is covered by tests.</li>
<li>Increases confidence in subsequent refactorings on affected code. For
example, if you want to refactor code that isn't already covered by
tests, submitting test CLs <em>before</em> submitting refactoring CLs can
validate that the tested behavior is unchanged before and after the
refactoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactoring the test code (e.g. introduce helper functions).</li>
<li>Introducing larger test framework code (e.g. an integration test).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="break"><a class="header" href="#break">Don't Break the Build</a></h2>
<p>If you have several CLs that depend on each other, you need to find a way to
make sure the whole system keeps working after each CL is submitted. Otherwise
you might break the build for all your fellow developers for a few minutes
between your CL submissions (or even longer if something goes wrong unexpectedly
with your later CL submissions).</p>
<h2 id="cant"><a class="header" href="#cant">Can't Make it Small Enough</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you will encounter situations where it seems like your CL <em>has</em> to be
large. This is very rarely true. Authors who practice writing small CLs can
almost always find a way to decompose functionality into a series of small
changes.</p>
<p>Before writing a large CL, consider whether preceding it with a refactoring-only
CL could pave the way for a cleaner implementation. Talk to your teammates and
see if anybody has thoughts on how to implement the functionality in small CLs
instead.</p>
<p>If all of these options fail (which should be extremely rare) then get consent
from your reviewers in advance to review a large CL, so they are warned about
what is coming. In this situation, expect to be going through the review process
for a long time, be vigilant about not introducing bugs, and be extra diligent
about writing tests.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="review/developer/handling-comments.html">How to Handle Reviewer Comments</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-handle-reviewer-comments"><a class="header" href="#how-to-handle-reviewer-comments">How to handle reviewer comments</a></h1>
<p>When you've sent a CL out for review, it's likely that your reviewer will
respond with several comments on your CL. Here are some useful things to know
about handling reviewer comments.</p>
<h2 id="personal"><a class="header" href="#personal">Don't Take it Personally</a></h2>
<p>The goal of review is to maintain the quality of our codebase and our products.
When a reviewer provides a critique of your code, think of it as their attempt
to help you, the codebase, and Google, rather than as a personal attack on you
or your abilities.</p>
<p>Sometimes reviewers feel frustrated and they express that frustration in their
comments. This isn't a good practice for reviewers, but as a developer you
should be prepared for this. Ask yourself, "What is the constructive thing that
the reviewer is trying to communicate to me?" and then operate as though that's
what they actually said.</p>
<p><strong>Never respond in anger to code review comments.</strong> That is a serious breach of
professional etiquette that will live forever in the code review tool. If you
are too angry or annoyed to respond kindly, then walk away from your computer
for a while, or work on something else until you feel calm enough to reply
politely.</p>
<p>In general, if a reviewer isn't providing feedback in a way that's constructive
and polite, explain this to them in person. If you can't talk to them in person
or on a video call, then send them a private email. Explain to them in a kind
way what you don't like and what you'd like them to do differently. If they also
respond in a non-constructive way to this private discussion, or it doesn't have
the intended effect, then
escalate to your manager as
appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="code"><a class="header" href="#code">Fix the Code</a></h2>
<p>If a reviewer says that they don't understand something in your code, your first
response should be to clarify the code itself. If the code can't be clarified,
add a code comment that explains why the code is there. If a comment seems
pointless, only then should your response be an explanation in the code review
tool.</p>
<p>If a reviewer didn't understand some piece of your code, it's likely other
future readers of the code won't understand either. Writing a response in the
code review tool doesn't help future code readers, but clarifying your code or
adding code comments does help them.</p>
<h2 id="think"><a class="header" href="#think">Think Collaboratively</a></h2>
<p>Writing a CL can take a lot of work. It's often really satisfying to finally
send one out for review, feel like it's done, and be pretty sure that no further
work is needed. It can be frustrating to receive comments asking for changes,
especially if you don't agree with them.</p>
<p>At times like this, take a moment to step back and consider if the reviewer is
providing valuable feedback that will help the codebase and Google. Your first
question to yourself should always be, "Do I understand what the reviewer is
asking for?"</p>
<p>If you can't answer that question, ask the reviewer for clarification.</p>
<p>And then, if you understand the comments but disagree with them, it's important
to think collaboratively, not combatively or defensively:</p>
<p>Bad: "No, I'm not going to do that."</p>
<p>Good: "I went with X because of [these pros/cons] with [these
tradeoffs].
My understanding is that using Y would be worse because of [these reasons]. Are
you suggesting that Y better serves the original tradeoffs, that we should weigh
the tradeoffs differently, or something else?"</p>
<p>Remember,
<strong><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/cr_respect.md">courtesy and respect</a>
should always be a first priority</strong>. If you disagree with the reviewer, find
ways to collaborate: ask for clarifications, discuss pros/cons, and provide
explanations of why your method of doing things is better for the codebase,
users, and/or Google.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you might know something about the users, codebase, or CL that the
reviewer doesn't know. <a href="review/developer/handling-comments.html#code">Fix the code</a> where appropriate, and engage your
reviewer in discussion, including giving them more context. Usually you can come
to some consensus between yourself and the reviewer based on technical facts.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts"><a class="header" href="#conflicts">Resolving Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>Your first step in resolving conflicts should always be to try to come to
consensus with your reviewer. If you can't achieve consensus, see
<a href="review/developer/../reviewer/standard.html">The Standard of Code Review</a>, which gives principles
to follow in such a situation.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-standard-of-code-review"><a class="header" href="#the-standard-of-code-review">The Standard of Code Review</a></h1>
<p>The primary purpose of code review is to make sure that the overall
code health of Google's code
base is improving over time. All of the tools and processes of code review are
designed to this end.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, a series of trade-offs have to be balanced.</p>
<p>First, developers must be able to <em>make progress</em> on their tasks. If you never
submit an improvement to the codebase, then the codebase never improves. Also,
if a reviewer makes it very difficult for <em>any</em> change to go in, then developers
are disincentivized to make improvements in the future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is the duty of the reviewer to make sure that each CL is
of such a quality that the overall code health of their codebase is not
decreasing as time goes on. This can be tricky, because often, codebases degrade
through small decreases in code health over time, especially when a team is
under significant time constraints and they feel that they have to take
shortcuts in order to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>Also, a reviewer has ownership and responsibility over the code they are
reviewing. They want to ensure that the codebase stays consistent, maintainable,
and all of the other things mentioned in
<a href="review/reviewer/looking-for.html">"What to look for in a code review."</a></p>
<p>Thus, we get the following rule as the standard we expect in code reviews:</p>
<p><strong>In general, reviewers should favor approving a CL once it is in a state where
it definitely improves the overall
code health of the system
being worked on, even if the CL isn't perfect.</strong></p>
<p>That is <em>the</em> senior principle among all of the code review guidelines.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this, of course. For example, if a CL adds a feature
that the reviewer doesn't want in their system, then the reviewer can certainly
deny approval even if the code is well-designed.</p>
<p>A key point here is that there is no such thing as "perfect" code—there is
only <em>better</em> code. Reviewers should not require the author to polish every tiny
piece of a CL before granting approval. Rather, the reviewer should balance out
the need to make forward progress compared to the importance of the changes they
are suggesting. Instead of seeking perfection, what a reviewer should seek is
<em>continuous improvement</em>. A CL that, as a whole, improves the maintainability,
readability, and understandability of the system shouldn't be delayed for days
or weeks because it isn't "perfect."</p>
<p>Reviewers should <em>always</em> feel free to leave comments expressing that something
could be better, but if it's not very important, prefix it with something like
"Nit: " to let the author know that it's just a point of polish that they could
choose to ignore.</p>
<p>Note: Nothing in this document justifies checking in CLs that definitely
<em>worsen</em> the overall code health of the system. The only time you would do that
would be in an <a href="review/reviewer/../emergencies.html">emergency</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mentoring"><a class="header" href="#mentoring">Mentoring</a></h2>
<p>Code review can have an important function of teaching developers something new
about a language, a framework, or general software design principles. It's
always fine to leave comments that help a developer learn something new. Sharing
knowledge is part of improving the code health of a system over time. Just keep
in mind that if your comment is purely educational, but not critical to meeting
the standards described in this document, prefix it with "Nit: " or otherwise
indicate that it's not mandatory for the author to resolve it in this CL.</p>
<h2 id="principles"><a class="header" href="#principles">Principles</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Technical facts and data overrule opinions and personal preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On matters of style, the <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/">style guide</a>
is the absolute authority. Any purely style point (whitespace, etc.) that is
not in the style guide is a matter of personal preference. The style should
be consistent with what is there. If there is no previous style, accept the
author's.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aspects of software design are almost never a pure style issue or just a
personal preference.</strong> They are based on underlying principles and should be
weighed on those principles, not simply by personal opinion. Sometimes there
are a few valid options. If the author can demonstrate (either through data
or based on solid engineering principles) that several approaches are
equally valid, then the reviewer should accept the preference of the author.
Otherwise the choice is dictated by standard principles of software design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no other rule applies, then the reviewer may ask the author to be
consistent with what is in the current codebase, as long as that doesn't
worsen the overall code health of the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conflicts"><a class="header" href="#conflicts">Resolving Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>In any conflict on a code review, the first step should always be for the
developer and reviewer to try to come to consensus, based on the contents of
this document and the other documents in
<a href="review/reviewer/../developer/index.html">The CL Author's Guide</a> and this
<a href="review/reviewer/index.html">Reviewer Guide</a>.</p>
<p>When coming to consensus becomes especially difficult, it can help to have a
face-to-face meeting or a video conference between the reviewer and the author, instead of
just trying to resolve the conflict through code review comments. (If you do
this, though, make sure to record the results of the discussion as a comment on
the CL, for future readers.)</p>
<p>If that doesn't resolve the situation, the most common way to resolve it would
be to escalate. Often the
escalation path is to a broader team discussion, having a Technical Lead weigh in, asking
for a decision from a maintainer of the code, or asking an Eng Manager to help
out. <strong>Don't let a CL sit around because the author and the reviewer can't come
to an agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Next: <a href="review/reviewer/looking-for.html">What to look for in a code review</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review"><a class="header" href="#what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review">What to look for in a code review</a></h1>
<p>Note: Always make sure to take into account
<a href="review/reviewer/standard.html">The Standard of Code Review</a> when considering each of these
points.</p>
<h2 id="design"><a class="header" href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<p>The most important thing to cover in a review is the overall design of the CL.
Do the interactions of various pieces of code in the CL make sense? Does this
change belong in your codebase, or in a library? Does it integrate well with the
rest of your system? Is now a good time to add this functionality?</p>
<h2 id="functionality"><a class="header" href="#functionality">Functionality</a></h2>
<p>Does this CL do what the developer intended? Is what the developer intended good
for the users of this code? The "users" are usually both end-users (when they
are affected by the change) and developers (who will have to "use" this code in
the future).</p>
<p>Mostly, we expect developers to test CLs well-enough that they work correctly by
the time they get to code review. However, as the reviewer you should still be
thinking about edge cases, looking for concurrency problems, trying to think
like a user, and making sure that there are no bugs that you see just by reading
the code.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> validate the CL if you want—the time when it's most important for a
reviewer to check a CL's behavior is when it has a user-facing impact, such as a
<strong>UI change</strong>. It's hard to understand how some changes will impact a user when
you're just reading the code. For changes like that, you can have the developer
give you a demo of the functionality if it's too inconvenient to patch in the CL
and try it yourself.</p>
<p>Another time when it's particularly important to think about functionality
during a code review is if there is some sort of <strong>parallel programming</strong> going
on in the CL that could theoretically cause deadlocks or race conditions. These
sorts of issues are very hard to detect by just running the code and usually
need somebody (both the developer and the reviewer) to think through them
carefully to be sure that problems aren't being introduced. (Note that this is
also a good reason not to use concurrency models where race conditions or
deadlocks are possible—it can make it very complex to do code reviews or
understand the code.)</p>
<h2 id="complexity"><a class="header" href="#complexity">Complexity</a></h2>
<p>Is the CL more complex than it should be? Check this at every level of the
CL—are individual lines too complex? Are functions too complex? Are classes too
complex? "Too complex" usually means <strong>"can't be understood quickly by code
readers."</strong> It can also mean <strong>"developers are likely to introduce bugs when
they try to call or modify this code."</strong></p>
<p>A particular type of complexity is <strong>over-engineering</strong>, where developers have
made the code more generic than it needs to be, or added functionality that
isn't presently needed by the system. Reviewers should be especially vigilant
about over-engineering. Encourage developers to solve the problem they know
needs to be solved <em>now</em>, not the problem that the developer speculates <em>might</em>
need to be solved in the future. The future problem should be solved once it
arrives and you can see its actual shape and requirements in the physical
universe.</p>
<h2 id="tests"><a class="header" href="#tests">Tests</a></h2>
<p>Ask for unit, integration, or end-to-end
tests as appropriate for the change. In general, tests should be added in the
same CL as the production code unless the CL is handling an
<a href="review/reviewer/../emergencies.html">emergency</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure that the tests in the CL are correct, sensible, and useful. Tests do
not test themselves, and we rarely write tests for our tests—a human must ensure
that tests are valid.</p>
<p>Will the tests actually fail when the code is broken? If the code changes
beneath them, will they start producing false positives? Does each test make
simple and useful assertions? Are the tests separated appropriately between
different test methods?</p>
<p>Remember that tests are also code that has to be maintained. Don't accept
complexity in tests just because they aren't part of the main binary.</p>
<h2 id="naming"><a class="header" href="#naming">Naming</a></h2>
<p>Did the developer pick good names for everything? A good name is long enough to
fully communicate what the item is or does, without being so long that it
becomes hard to read.</p>
<h2 id="comments"><a class="header" href="#comments">Comments</a></h2>
<p>Did the developer write clear comments in understandable English? Are all of the
comments actually necessary? Usually comments are useful when they <strong>explain
why</strong> some code exists, and should not be explaining <em>what</em> some code is doing.
If the code isn't clear enough to explain itself, then the code should be made
simpler. There are some exceptions (regular expressions and complex algorithms
often benefit greatly from comments that explain what they're doing, for
example) but mostly comments are for information that the code itself can't
possibly contain, like the reasoning behind a decision.</p>
<p>It can also be helpful to look at comments that were there before this CL. Maybe
there is a TODO that can be removed now, a comment advising against this change
being made, etc.</p>
<p>Note that comments are different from <em>documentation</em> of classes, modules, or
functions, which should instead express the purpose of a piece of code, how it
should be used, and how it behaves when used.</p>
<h2 id="style"><a class="header" href="#style">Style</a></h2>
<p>We have <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/">style guides</a> at Google for all
of our major languages, and even for most of the minor languages. Make sure the
CL follows the appropriate style guides.</p>
<p>If you want to improve some style point that isn't in the style guide, prefix
your comment with "Nit:" to let the developer know that it's a nitpick that you
think would improve the code but isn't mandatory. Don't block CLs from being
submitted based only on personal style preferences.</p>
<p>The author of the CL should not include major style changes combined with other
changes. It makes it hard to see what is being changed in the CL, makes merges
and rollbacks more complex, and causes other problems. For example, if the
author wants to reformat the whole file, have them send you just the
reformatting as one CL, and then send another CL with their functional changes
after that.</p>
<h2 id="consistency"><a class="header" href="#consistency">Consistency</a></h2>
<p>What if the existing code is inconsistent with the style guide? Per our
<a href="review/reviewer/standard.html#principles">code review principles</a>, the style guide is the
absolute authority: if something is required by the style guide, the CL should
follow the guidelines.</p>
<p>In some cases, the style guide makes recommendations rather than declaring
requirements. In these cases, it's a judgment call whether the new code should
be consistent with the recommendations or the surrounding code. Bias towards
following the style guide unless the local inconsistency would be too confusing.</p>
<p>If no other rule applies, the author should maintain consistency with the
existing code.</p>
<p>Either way, encourage the author to file a bug and add a TODO for cleaning up
existing code.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>If a CL changes how users build, test, interact with, or release code, check to
see that it also updates associated documentation, including
READMEs, g3doc pages, and any generated
reference docs. If the CL deletes or deprecates code, consider whether the
documentation should also be deleted.
If documentation is
missing, ask for it.</p>
<h2 id="every-line"><a class="header" href="#every-line">Every Line</a></h2>
<p>In the general case, look at <em>every</em> line of code that you have been assigned to
review. Some things like data files, generated code, or large data structures
you can scan over sometimes, but don't scan over a human-written class,
function, or block of code and assume that what's inside of it is okay.
Obviously some code deserves more careful scrutiny than other code—that's
a judgment call that you have to make—but you should at least be sure that
you <em>understand</em> what all the code is doing.</p>
<p>If it's too hard for you to read the code and this is slowing down the review,
then you should let the developer know that
and wait for them to clarify it before you try to review it. At Google, we hire
great software engineers, and you are one of them. If you can't understand the
code, it's very likely that other developers won't either. So you're also
helping future developers understand this code, when you ask the developer to
clarify it.</p>
<p>If you understand the code but you don't feel qualified to do some part of the
review, <a href="review/reviewer/looking-for.html#every-line-exceptions">make sure there is a reviewer</a> on the CL who is
qualified, particularly for complex issues such as privacy, security,
concurrency, accessibility, internationalization, etc.</p>
<h3 id="every-line-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#every-line-exceptions">Exceptions</a></h3>
<p>What if it doesn't make sense for you to review every line? For example, you are
one of multiple reviewers on a CL and may be asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>To review only certain files that are part of a larger change.</li>
<li>To review only certain aspects of the CL, such as the high-level design,
privacy or security implications, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, note in a comment which parts you reviewed. Prefer giving
<a href="review/reviewer/speed.html#lgtm-with-comments">LGTM with comments</a>
.</p>
<p>If you instead wish to grant LGTM after confirming that other reviewers have
reviewed other parts of the CL, note this explicitly in a comment to set
expectations. Aim to <a href="review/reviewer/speed.html#responses">respond quickly</a> once the CL has
reached the desired state.</p>
<h2 id="context"><a class="header" href="#context">Context</a></h2>
<p>It is often helpful to look at the CL in a broad context. Usually the code
review tool will only show you a few lines of code around the parts that are
being changed. Sometimes you have to look at the whole file to be sure that the
change actually makes sense. For example, you might see only four new lines
being added, but when you look at the whole file, you see those four lines are
in a 50-line method that now really needs to be broken up into smaller methods.</p>
<p>It's also useful to think about the CL in the context of the system as a whole.
Is this CL improving the code health of the system or is it making the whole
system more complex, less tested, etc.? <strong>Don't accept CLs that degrade the code
health of the system.</strong> Most systems become complex through many small changes
that add up, so it's important to prevent even small complexities in new
changes.</p>
<h2 id="good-things"><a class="header" href="#good-things">Good Things</a></h2>
<p>If you see something nice in the CL, tell the developer, especially when they
addressed one of your comments in a great way. Code reviews often just focus on
mistakes, but they should offer encouragement and appreciation for good
practices, as well. It’s sometimes even more valuable, in terms of mentoring, to
tell a developer what they did right than to tell them what they did wrong.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>In doing a code review, you should make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is well-designed.</li>
<li>The functionality is good for the users of the code.</li>
<li>Any UI changes are sensible and look good.</li>
<li>Any parallel programming is done safely.</li>
<li>The code isn't more complex than it needs to be.</li>
<li>The developer isn't implementing things they <em>might</em> need in the future but
don't know they need now.</li>
<li>Code has appropriate unit tests.</li>
<li>Tests are well-designed.</li>
<li>The developer used clear names for everything.</li>
<li>Comments are clear and useful, and mostly explain <em>why</em> instead of <em>what</em>.</li>
<li>Code is appropriately documented (generally in g3doc).</li>
<li>The code conforms to our style guides.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to review <strong>every line</strong> of code you've been asked to review, look at
the <strong>context</strong>, make sure you're <strong>improving code health</strong>, and compliment
developers on <strong>good things</strong> that they do.</p>

<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Now that you know <a href="review/reviewer/looking-for.html">what to look for</a>, what's the most efficient
way to manage a review that's spread across multiple files?</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the change make sense? Does it have a good
<a href="review/reviewer/../developer/cl-descriptions.html">description</a>?</li>
<li>Look at the most important part of the change first. Is it well-designed
overall?</li>
<li>Look at the rest of the CL in an appropriate sequence.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step_one"><a class="header" href="#step_one">Step One: Take a broad view of the change</a></h2>
<p>Look at the <a href="review/reviewer/../developer/cl-descriptions.html">CL description</a> and what the CL
does in general. Does this change even make sense? If this change shouldn't have
happened in the first place, please respond immediately with an explanation of
why the change should not be happening. When you reject a change like this, it's
also a good idea to suggest to the developer what they should have done instead.</p>
<p>For example, you might say "Looks like you put some good work into this, thanks!
However, we're actually going in the direction of removing the FooWidget system
that you're modifying here, and so we don't want to make any new modifications
to it right now. How about instead you refactor our new BarWidget class?"</p>
<p>Note that not only did the reviewer reject the current CL and provide an
alternative suggestion, but they did it <em>courteously</em>. This kind of courtesy is
important because we want to show that we respect each other as developers even
when we disagree.</p>
<p>If you get more than a few CLs that represent changes you don't want to make,
you should consider re-working your team's development process or the posted
process for external contributors so that there is more communication before CLs
are written. It's better to tell people "no" before they've done a ton of work
that now has to be thrown away or drastically re-written.</p>
<h2 id="step_two"><a class="header" href="#step_two">Step Two: Examine the main parts of the CL</a></h2>
<p>Find the file or files that are the "main" part of this CL. Often, there is one
file that has the largest number of logical changes, and it's the major piece of
the CL. Look at these major parts first. This helps give context to all of the
smaller parts of the CL, and generally accelerates doing the code review. If the
CL is too large for you to figure out which parts are the major parts, ask the
developer what you should look at first, or ask them to
<a href="review/reviewer/../developer/small-cls.html">split up the CL into multiple CLs</a>.</p>
<p>If you see some major design problems with this part of the CL, you should send
those comments immediately, even if you don't have time to review the rest of
the CL right now. In fact, reviewing the rest of the CL might be a waste of
time, because if the design problems are significant enough, a lot of the other
code under review is going to disappear and not matter anyway.</p>
<p>There are two major reasons it's so important to send these major design
comments out immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers often mail a CL and then immediately start new work based on that
CL while they wait for review. If there are major design problems in the CL
you're reviewing, they're also going to have to re-work their later CL. You
want to catch them before they've done too much extra work on top of the
problematic design.</li>
<li>Major design changes take longer to do than small changes. Developers nearly
all have deadlines; in order to make those deadlines and still have quality
code in the codebase, the developer needs to start on any major re-work of
the CL as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step_three"><a class="header" href="#step_three">Step Three: Look through the rest of the CL in an appropriate sequence</a></h2>
<p>Once you've confirmed there are no major design problems with the CL as a whole,
try to figure out a logical sequence to look through the files while also making
sure you don't miss reviewing any file. Usually after you've looked through the
major files, it's simplest to just go through each file in the order that
the code review tool presents them to you. Sometimes it's also helpful to read the tests
first before you read the main code, because then you have an idea of what the
change is supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="review/reviewer/speed.html">Speed of Code Reviews</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="speed-of-code-reviews"><a class="header" href="#speed-of-code-reviews">Speed of Code Reviews</a></h1>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why Should Code Reviews Be Fast?</a></h2>
<p><strong>At Google, we optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce
a product together</strong>, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an
individual developer can write code. The speed of individual development is
important, it's just not <em>as</em> important as the velocity of the entire team.</p>
<p>When code reviews are slow, several things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The velocity of the team as a whole is decreased.</strong> Yes, the individual
who doesn't respond quickly to the review gets other work done. However, new
features and bug fixes for the rest of the team are delayed by days, weeks,
or months as each CL waits for review and re-review.</li>
<li><strong>Developers start to protest the code review process.</strong> If a reviewer only
responds every few days, but requests major changes to the CL each time,
that can be frustrating and difficult for developers. Often, this is
expressed as complaints about how "strict" the reviewer is being. If the
reviewer requests the <em>same</em> substantial changes (changes which really do
improve code health), but responds <em>quickly</em> every time the developer makes
an update, the complaints tend to disappear. <strong>Most complaints about the
code review process are actually resolved by making the process faster.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Code health can be impacted.</strong> When reviews are slow, there is increased
pressure to allow developers to submit CLs that are not as good as they
could be. Slow reviews also discourage code cleanups, refactorings, and
further improvements to existing CLs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fast"><a class="header" href="#fast">How Fast Should Code Reviews Be?</a></h2>
<p>If you are not in the middle of a focused task, <strong>you should do a code review
shortly after it comes in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One business day is the maximum time it should take to respond</strong> to a code
review request (i.e., first thing the next morning).</p>
<p>Following these guidelines means that a typical CL should get multiple rounds of
review (if needed) within a single day.</p>
<h2 id="interruption"><a class="header" href="#interruption">Speed vs. Interruption</a></h2>
<p>There is one time where the consideration of personal velocity trumps team
velocity. <strong>If you are in the middle of a focused task, such as writing code,
don't interrupt yourself to do a code review.</strong>
Research has shown that it can
take a long time for a developer to get back into a smooth flow of development
after being interrupted. So interrupting yourself while coding is actually
<em>more</em> expensive to the team than making another developer wait a bit for a code
review.</p>
<p>Instead, wait for a break point in your work before you respond to a request for
review. This could be when your current coding task is completed, after lunch,
returning from a meeting, coming back from the breakroom, etc.</p>
<h2 id="responses"><a class="header" href="#responses">Fast Responses</a></h2>
<p>When we talk about the speed of code reviews, it is the <em>response</em> time that we
are concerned with, as opposed to how long it takes a CL to get through the
whole review and be submitted. The whole process should also be fast, ideally,
but <strong>it's even more important for the <em>individual responses</em> to come quickly
than it is for the whole process to happen rapidly.</strong></p>
<p>Even if it sometimes takes a long time to get through the entire review
<em>process</em>, having quick responses from the reviewer throughout the process
significantly eases the frustration developers can feel with "slow" code
reviews.</p>
<p>If you are too busy to do a full review on a CL when it comes in, you can still
send a quick response that lets the developer know when you will get to it,
suggest other reviewers who might be able to respond more quickly, or
<a href="review/reviewer/navigate.html">provide some initial broad comments</a>. (Note: none of this means
you should interrupt coding even to send a response like this—send the
response at a reasonable break point in your work.)</p>
<p><strong>It is important that reviewers spend enough time on review that they are
certain their "LGTM" means "this code meets <a href="review/reviewer/standard.html">our standards</a>."</strong>
However, individual responses should still ideally be <a href="review/reviewer/speed.html#fast">fast</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tz"><a class="header" href="#tz">Cross-Time-Zone Reviews</a></h2>
<p>When dealing with time zone differences, try to get back to the author while
they have time to respond before the end of their working hours. If they have
already finished work for the day, then try to make sure your review is done
before they start work the next day.</p>
<h2 id="lgtm-with-comments"><a class="header" href="#lgtm-with-comments">LGTM With Comments</a></h2>
<p>In order to speed up code reviews, there are certain situations in which a
reviewer should give LGTM/Approval even though they are also leaving unresolved
comments on the CL. This is done when either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reviewer is confident that the developer will appropriately address all
the reviewer's remaining comments.</li>
<li>The remaining changes are minor and don't <em>have</em> to be done by the
developer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reviewer should specify which of these options they intend, if it is not
otherwise clear.</p>
<p>LGTM With Comments is especially worth considering when the developer and
reviewer are in different time zones and otherwise the developer would be
waiting for a whole day just to get "LGTM, Approval."</p>
<h2 id="large"><a class="header" href="#large">Large CLs</a></h2>
<p>If somebody sends you a code review that is so large you're not sure when you
will be able to have time to review it, your typical response should be to ask
the developer to
<a href="review/reviewer/../developer/small-cls.html">split the CL into several smaller CLs</a> that build on
each other, instead of one huge CL that has to be reviewed all at once. This is
usually possible and very helpful to reviewers, even if it takes additional work
from the developer.</p>
<p>If a CL <em>can't</em> be broken up into smaller CLs, and you don't have time to review
the entire thing quickly, then at least write some comments on the overall
design of the CL and send it back to the developer for improvement. One of your
goals as a reviewer should be to always unblock the developer or enable them to
take some sort of further action quickly, without sacrificing code health to do
so.</p>
<h2 id="time"><a class="header" href="#time">Code Review Improvements Over Time</a></h2>
<p>If you follow these guidelines and you are strict with your code reviews, you
should find that the entire code review process tends to go faster and faster
over time. Developers learn what is required for healthy code, and send you CLs
that are great from the start, requiring less and less review time. Reviewers
learn to respond quickly and not add unnecessary latency into the review
process.
But <strong>don't compromise on
the <a href="review/reviewer/standard.html">code review standards</a> or quality for an imagined improvement
in velocity</strong>—it's not actually going to make anything happen more
quickly, in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="emergencies"><a class="header" href="#emergencies">Emergencies</a></h2>
<p>There are also <a href="review/reviewer/../emergencies.html">emergencies</a> where CLs must pass through the
<em>whole</em> review process very quickly, and where the quality guidelines would be
relaxed. However, please see <a href="review/reviewer/../emergencies.html#what">What Is An Emergency?</a> for
a description of which situations actually qualify as emergencies and which
don't.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="review/reviewer/comments.html">How to Write Code Review Comments</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-write-code-review-comments"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-code-review-comments">How to write code review comments</a></h1>
<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="header" href="#summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Be kind.</li>
<li>Explain your reasoning.</li>
<li>Balance giving explicit directions with just pointing out problems and
letting the developer decide.</li>
<li>Encourage developers to simplify code or add code comments instead of just
explaining the complexity to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="courtesy"><a class="header" href="#courtesy">Courtesy</a></h2>
<p>In general, it is important to be
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/cr_respect.md">courteous and respectful</a>
while also being very clear and helpful to the developer whose code you are
reviewing. One way to do this is to be sure that you are always making comments
about the <em>code</em> and never making comments about the <em>developer</em>. You don't
always have to follow this practice, but you should definitely use it when
saying something that might otherwise be upsetting or contentious. For example:</p>
<p>Bad: "Why did <strong>you</strong> use threads here when there's obviously no benefit to be
gained from concurrency?"</p>
<p>Good: "The concurrency model here is adding complexity to the system without any
actual performance benefit that I can see. Because there's no performance
benefit, it's best for this code to be single-threaded instead of using multiple
threads."</p>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Explain Why</a></h2>
<p>One thing you'll notice about the "good" example from above is that it helps the
developer understand <em>why</em> you are making your comment. You don't always need to
include this information in your review comments, but sometimes it's appropriate
to give a bit more explanation around your intent, the best practice you're
following, or how your suggestion improves code health.</p>
<h2 id="guidance"><a class="header" href="#guidance">Giving Guidance</a></h2>
<p><strong>In general it is the developer's responsibility to fix a CL, not the
reviewer's.</strong> You are not required to do detailed design of a solution or write
code for the developer.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean the reviewer should be unhelpful, though. In general you
should strike an appropriate balance between pointing out problems and providing
direct guidance. Pointing out problems and letting the developer make a decision
often helps the developer learn, and makes it easier to do code reviews. It also
can result in a better solution, because the developer is closer to the code
than the reviewer is.</p>
<p>However, sometimes direct instructions, suggestions, or even code are more
helpful. The primary goal of code review is to get the best CL possible. A
secondary goal is improving the skills of developers so that they require less
and less review over time.</p>
<p>Remember that people learn from reinforcement of what they are doing well and
not just what they could do better. If you see things you like in the CL,
comment on those too! Examples: developer cleaned up a messy algorithm, added
exemplary test coverage, or you as the reviewer learned something from the CL.
Just as with all comments, include <a href="review/reviewer/comments.html#why">why</a> you liked something, further
encouraging the developer to continue good practices.</p>
<h2 id="label-comment-severity"><a class="header" href="#label-comment-severity">Label comment severity</a></h2>
<p>Consider labeling the severity of your comments, differentiating required
changes from guidelines or suggestions.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nit: This is a minor thing. Technically you should do it, but it won’t hugely
impact things.</p>
<p>Optional (or Consider): I think this may be a good idea, but it’s not strictly
required.</p>
<p>FYI: I don’t expect you to do this in this CL, but you may find this
interesting to think about for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes review intent explicit and helps authors prioritize the importance of
various comments. It also helps avoid misunderstandings; for example, without
comment labels, authors may interpret all comments as mandatory, even if some
comments are merely intended to be informational or optional.</p>
<h2 id="explanations"><a class="header" href="#explanations">Accepting Explanations</a></h2>
<p>If you ask a developer to explain a piece of code that you don't understand,
that should usually result in them <strong>rewriting the code more clearly</strong>.
Occasionally, adding a comment in the code is also an appropriate response, as
long as it's not just explaining overly complex code.</p>
<p><strong>Explanations written only in the code review tool are not helpful to future
code readers.</strong> They are acceptable only in a few circumstances, such as when
you are reviewing an area you are not very familiar with and the developer
explains something that normal readers of the code would have already known.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="review/reviewer/pushback.html">Handling Pushback in Code Reviews</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="handling-pushback-in-code-reviews"><a class="header" href="#handling-pushback-in-code-reviews">Handling pushback in code reviews</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes a developer will push back on a code review. Either they will disagree
with your suggestion or they will complain that you are being too strict in
general.</p>
<h2 id="who_is_right"><a class="header" href="#who_is_right">Who is right?</a></h2>
<p>When a developer disagrees with your suggestion, first take a moment to consider
if they are correct. Often, they are closer to the code than you are, and so
they might really have a better insight about certain aspects of it. Does their
argument make sense? Does it make sense from a code health perspective? If so,
let them know that they are right and let the issue drop.</p>
<p>However, developers are not always right. In this case the reviewer should
further explain why they believe that their suggestion is correct. A good
explanation demonstrates both an understanding of the developer's reply, and
additional information about why the change is being requested.</p>
<p>In particular, when the reviewer believes their suggestion will improve code
health, they should continue to advocate for the change, if they believe the
resulting code quality improvement justifies the additional work requested.
<strong>Improving code health tends to happen in small steps.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a few rounds of explaining a suggestion before it really
sinks in. Just make sure to always stay <a href="review/reviewer/comments.html#courtesy">polite</a> and let
the developer know that you <em>hear</em> what they're saying, you just don't <em>agree</em>.</p>
<h2 id="upsetting_developers"><a class="header" href="#upsetting_developers">Upsetting Developers</a></h2>
<p>Reviewers sometimes believe that the developer will be upset if the reviewer
insists on an improvement. Sometimes developers do become upset, but it is
usually brief and they become very thankful later that you helped them improve
the quality of their code. Usually, if you are <a href="review/reviewer/comments.html#courtesy">polite</a> in
your comments, developers actually don't become upset at all, and the worry is
just in the reviewer's mind. Upsets are usually more about
<a href="review/reviewer/comments.html#courtesy">the way comments are written</a> than about the reviewer's
insistence on code quality.</p>
<h2 id="later"><a class="header" href="#later">Cleaning It Up Later</a></h2>
<p>A common source of push back is that developers (understandably) want to get
things done. They don't want to go through another round of review just to get
this CL in. So they say they will clean something up in a later CL, and thus you
should LGTM <em>this</em> CL now. Some developers are very good about this, and will
immediately write a follow-up CL that fixes the issue. However, experience shows
that as more time passes after a developer writes the original CL, the less
likely this clean up is to happen. In fact, usually unless the developer does
the clean up <em>immediately</em> after the present CL, it never happens. This isn't
because developers are irresponsible, but because they have a lot of work to do
and the cleanup gets lost or forgotten in the press of other work. Thus, it is
usually best to insist that the developer clean up their CL <em>now</em>, before the
code is in the codebase and "done." Letting people "clean things up later" is a
common way for codebases to degenerate.</p>
<p>If a CL introduces new complexity, it must be cleaned up before submission
unless it is an <a href="review/reviewer/../emergencies.html">emergency</a>. If the CL exposes surrounding
problems and they can't be addressed right now, the developer should file a bug
for the cleanup and assign it to themselves so that it doesn't get lost. They
can optionally also write a TODO comment in the code that references the filed
bug.</p>
<h2 id="strictness"><a class="header" href="#strictness">General Complaints About Strictness</a></h2>
<p>If you previously had fairly lax code reviews and you switch to having strict
reviews, some developers will complain very loudly. Improving the
<a href="review/reviewer/speed.html">speed</a> of your code reviews usually causes these complaints to fade
away.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can take months for these complaints to fade away, but eventually
developers tend to see the value of strict code reviews as they see what great
code they help generate. Sometimes the loudest protesters even become your
strongest supporters once something happens that causes them to really see the
value you're adding by being strict.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts"><a class="header" href="#conflicts">Resolving Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>If you are following all of the above but you still encounter a conflict between
yourself and a developer that can't be resolved, see
<a href="review/reviewer/standard.html">The Standard of Code Review</a> for guidelines and principles that
can help resolve the conflict.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="emergencies-1"><a class="header" href="#emergencies-1">Emergencies</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes there are emergency CLs that must pass through the entire code review
process as quickly as
possible.</p>
<h2 id="what"><a class="header" href="#what">What Is An Emergency?</a></h2>
<p>An emergency CL would be a <strong>small</strong> change that: allows a major launch to
continue instead of rolling back, fixes a bug significantly affecting users in
production, handles a pressing legal issue, closes a major security hole, etc.</p>
<p>In emergencies we really do care about the speed of the entire code review
process, not just the <a href="review/reviewer/speed.html">speed of response</a>. In this case
<em>only</em>, the reviewer should care more about the speed of the review and the
correctness of the code (does it actually resolve the emergency?) than anything
else. Also (perhaps obviously) such reviews should take priority over all other
code reviews, when they come up.</p>
<p>However, after the emergency is resolved you should look over the emergency CLs
again and give them a <a href="review/reviewer/looking-for.html">more thorough review</a>.</p>
<h2 id="not"><a class="header" href="#not">What Is NOT An Emergency?</a></h2>
<p>To be clear, the following cases are <em>not</em> an emergency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanting to launch this week rather than next week (unless there is some
actual <a href="review/emergencies.html#deadlines">hard deadline</a> for launch such as a partner agreement).</li>
<li>The developer has worked on a feature for a very long time and they really
want to get the CL in.</li>
<li>The reviewers are all in another timezone where it is currently nighttime or
they are away on an off-site.</li>
<li>It is the end of the day on a Friday and it would just be great to get this
CL in before the developer leaves for the weekend.</li>
<li>A manager says that this review has to be complete and the CL checked in
today because of a <a href="review/emergencies.html#deadlines">soft (not hard) deadline</a>.</li>
<li>Rolling back a CL that is causing test failures or build breakages.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines"><a class="header" href="#deadlines">What Is a Hard Deadline?</a></h2>
<p>A hard deadline is one where <strong>something disastrous would happen</strong> if you miss
it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting your CL by a certain date is necessary for a contractual
obligation.</li>
<li>Your product will completely fail in the marketplace if not released by a
certain date.</li>
<li>Some hardware manufacturers only ship new hardware once a year. If you miss
the deadline to submit code to them, that could be disastrous, depending on
what type of code you're trying to ship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delaying a release for a week is not disastrous. Missing an important conference
might be disastrous, but often is not.</p>
<p>Most deadlines are soft deadlines, not hard deadlines. They represent a desire
for a feature to be done by a certain time. They are important, but you
shouldn't be sacrificing code health to make them.</p>
<p>If you have a long release cycle (several weeks) it can be tempting to sacrifice
code review quality to get a feature in before the next cycle. However, this
pattern, if repeated, is a common way for projects to build up overwhelming
technical debt. If developers are routinely submitting CLs near the end of the
cycle that "must get in" with only superficial review, then the team should
modify its process so that large feature changes happen early in the cycle and
have enough time for good review.</p>
