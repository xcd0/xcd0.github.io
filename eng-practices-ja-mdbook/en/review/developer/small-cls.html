<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why Write Small CLs?</a></h2>
<p>Small, simple CLs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviewed more quickly.</strong> It's easier for a reviewer to find five minutes
several times to review small CLs than to set aside a 30 minute block to
review one large CL.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewed more thoroughly.</strong> With large changes, reviewers and authors tend
to get frustrated by large volumes of detailed commentary shifting back and
forth—sometimes to the point where important points get missed or dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Less likely to introduce bugs.</strong> Since you're making fewer changes, it's
easier for you and your reviewer to reason effectively about the impact of
the CL and see if a bug has been introduced.</li>
<li><strong>Less wasted work if they are rejected.</strong> If you write a huge CL and then
your reviewer says that the overall direction is wrong, you've wasted a lot
of work.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to merge.</strong> Working on a large CL takes a long time, so you will
have lots of conflicts when you merge, and you will have to merge
frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to design well.</strong> It's a lot easier to polish the design and code
health of a small change than it is to refine all the details of a large
change.</li>
<li><strong>Less blocking on reviews.</strong> Sending self-contained portions of your
overall change allows you to continue coding while you wait for your current
CL in review.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler to roll back.</strong> A large CL will more likely touch files that get
updated between the initial CL submission and a rollback CL, complicating
the rollback (the intermediate CLs will probably need to be rolled back
too).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <strong>reviewers have discretion to reject your change outright for the
sole reason of it being too large.</strong> Usually they will thank you for your
contribution but request that you somehow make it into a series of smaller
changes. It can be a lot of work to split up a change after you've already
written it, or require lots of time arguing about why the reviewer should accept
your large change. It's easier to just write small CLs in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="what_is_small"><a class="header" href="#what_is_small">What is Small?</a></h2>
<p>In general, the right size for a CL is <strong>one self-contained change</strong>. This means
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CL makes a minimal change that addresses <strong>just one thing</strong>. This is
usually just one part of a feature, rather than a whole feature at once. In
general it's better to err on the side of writing CLs that are too small vs.
CLs that are too large. Work with your reviewer to find out what an
acceptable size is.</li>
<li>The CL should <a href="#test_code">include related test code</a>.</li>
<li>Everything the reviewer needs to understand about the CL (except future
development) is in the CL, the CL's description, the existing codebase, or a
CL they've already reviewed.</li>
<li>The system will continue to work well for its users and for the developers
after the CL is checked in.</li>
<li>The CL is not so small that its implications are difficult to understand. If
you add a new API, you should include a usage of the API in the same CL so
that reviewers can better understand how the API will be used. This also
prevents checking in unused APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules about how large is &quot;too large.&quot; 100 lines is
usually a reasonable size for a CL, and 1000 lines is usually too large, but
it's up to the judgment of your reviewer. The number of files that a change is
spread across also affects its &quot;size.&quot; A 200-line change in one file might be
okay, but spread across 50 files it would usually be too large.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that although you have been intimately involved with your code from
the moment you started to write it, the reviewer often has no context. What
seems like an acceptably-sized CL to you might be overwhelming to your reviewer.
When in doubt, write CLs that are smaller than you think you need to write.
Reviewers rarely complain about getting CLs that are too small.</p>
<h2 id="large_okay"><a class="header" href="#large_okay">When are Large CLs Okay?</a></h2>
<p>There are a few situations in which large changes aren't as bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can usually count deletion of an entire file as being just one line of
change, because it doesn't take the reviewer very long to review.</li>
<li>Sometimes a large CL has been generated by an automatic refactoring tool
that you trust completely, and the reviewer's job is just to verify and say
that they really do want the change. These CLs can be larger, although some
of the caveats from above (such as merging and testing) still apply.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="efficiently"><a class="header" href="#efficiently">Writing Small CLs Efficiently</a></h2>
<p>If you write a small CL and then you wait for your reviewer to approve it before
you write your next CL, then you're going to waste a lot of time. So you want to
find some way to work that won't block you while you're waiting for review. This
could involve having multiple projects to work on simultaneously, finding
reviewers who agree to be immediately available, doing in-person reviews, pair
programming, or splitting your CLs in a way that allows you to continue working
immediately.</p>
<h2 id="splitting"><a class="header" href="#splitting">Splitting CLs</a></h2>
<p>When starting work that will have multiple CLs with potential dependencies among
each other, it's often useful to think about how to split and organize those CLs
at a high level before diving into coding.</p>
<p>Besides making things easier for you as an author to manage and organize your
CLs, it also makes things easier for your code reviewers, which in turn makes
your code reviews more efficient.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies for splitting work into different CLs.</p>
<h3 id="stacking"><a class="header" href="#stacking">Stacking Multiple Changes on Top of Each Other</a></h3>
<p>One way to split up a CL without blocking yourself is to write one small CL,
send it off for review, and then immediately start writing another CL <em>based</em> on
the first CL. Most version control systems allow you to do this somehow.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-files"><a class="header" href="#splitting-files">Splitting by Files</a></h3>
<p>Another way to split up a CL is by groupings of files that will require
different reviewers but are otherwise self-contained changes.</p>
<p>For example: you send off one CL for modifications to a protocol buffer and
another CL for changes to the code that uses that proto. You have to submit the
proto CL before the code CL, but they can both be reviewed simultaneously. If
you do this, you might want to inform both sets of reviewers about the other CL
that you wrote, so that they have context for your changes.</p>
<p>Another example: you send one CL for a code change and another for the
configuration or experiment that uses that code; this is easier to roll back
too, if necessary, as configuration/experiment files are sometimes pushed to
production faster than code changes.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-horizontally"><a class="header" href="#splitting-horizontally">Splitting Horizontally</a></h3>
<p>Consider creating shared code or stubs that help isolate changes between layers
of the tech stack. This not only helps expedite development but also encourages
abstraction between layers.</p>
<p>For example: You created a calculator app with client, API, service, and data
model layers. A shared proto signature can abstract the service and data model
layers from each other. Similarly, an API stub can split the implementation of
client code from service code and enable them to move forward independently.
Similar ideas can also be applied to more granular function or class level
abstractions.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-vertically"><a class="header" href="#splitting-vertically">Splitting Vertically</a></h3>
<p>Orthogonal to the layered, horizontal approach, you can instead break down your
code into smaller, full-stack, vertical features. Each of these features can be
independent parallel implementation tracks. This enables some tracks to move
forward while other tracks are awaiting review or feedback.</p>
<p>Back to our calculator example from
<a href="#splitting-horizontally">Splitting Horizontally</a>. You now want to support new
operators, like multiplication and division. You could split this up by
implementing multiplication and division as separate verticals or sub-features,
even though they may have some overlap such as shared button styling or shared
validation logic.</p>
<h3 id="splitting-grid"><a class="header" href="#splitting-grid">Splitting Horizontally &amp; Vertically</a></h3>
<p>To take this a step further, you could combine these approaches and chart out an
implementation plan like this, where each cell is its own standalone CL.
Starting from the model (at the bottom) and working up to the client:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Layer</th><th>Feature: Multiplication</th><th>Feature: Division</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Client</td><td>Add button</td><td>Add button</td></tr>
<tr><td>API</td><td>Add endpoint</td><td>Add endpoint</td></tr>
<tr><td>Service</td><td>Implement transformations</td><td>Share transformation logic with</td></tr>
<tr><td>:         :                           : multiplication                  :</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>Add proto definition</td><td>Add proto definition</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h2 id="refactoring"><a class="header" href="#refactoring">Separate Out Refactorings</a></h2>
<p>It's usually best to do refactorings in a separate CL from feature changes or
bug fixes. For example, moving and renaming a class should be in a different CL
from fixing a bug in that class. It is much easier for reviewers to understand
the changes introduced by each CL when they are separate.</p>
<p>Small cleanups such as fixing a local variable name can be included inside of a
feature change or bug fix CL, though. It's up to the judgment of developers and
reviewers to decide when a refactoring is so large that it will make the review
more difficult if included in your current CL.</p>
<h2 id="test_code"><a class="header" href="#test_code">Keep related test code in the same CL</a></h2>
<p>CLs should include related test code. Remember that <a href="#what_is_small">smallness</a>
here refers the conceptual idea that the CL should be focused and is not a
simplistic function on line count.</p>
<p>Tests are expected for all Google changes.</p>
<p>A CL that adds or changes logic should be accompanied by new or updated tests
for the new behavior. Pure refactoring CLs (that aren't intended to change
behavior) should also be covered by tests; ideally, these tests already exist,
but if they don't, you should add them.</p>
<p><em>Independent</em> test modifications can go into separate CLs first, similar to the
<a href="#refactoring">refactorings guidelines</a>. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validating pre-existing, submitted code with new tests.
<ul>
<li>Ensures that important logic is covered by tests.</li>
<li>Increases confidence in subsequent refactorings on affected code. For
example, if you want to refactor code that isn't already covered by
tests, submitting test CLs <em>before</em> submitting refactoring CLs can
validate that the tested behavior is unchanged before and after the
refactoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactoring the test code (e.g. introduce helper functions).</li>
<li>Introducing larger test framework code (e.g. an integration test).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="break"><a class="header" href="#break">Don't Break the Build</a></h2>
<p>If you have several CLs that depend on each other, you need to find a way to
make sure the whole system keeps working after each CL is submitted. Otherwise
you might break the build for all your fellow developers for a few minutes
between your CL submissions (or even longer if something goes wrong unexpectedly
with your later CL submissions).</p>
<h2 id="cant"><a class="header" href="#cant">Can't Make it Small Enough</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you will encounter situations where it seems like your CL <em>has</em> to be
large. This is very rarely true. Authors who practice writing small CLs can
almost always find a way to decompose functionality into a series of small
changes.</p>
<p>Before writing a large CL, consider whether preceding it with a refactoring-only
CL could pave the way for a cleaner implementation. Talk to your teammates and
see if anybody has thoughts on how to implement the functionality in small CLs
instead.</p>
<p>If all of these options fail (which should be extremely rare) then get consent
from your reviewers in advance to review a large CL, so they are warned about
what is coming. In this situation, expect to be going through the review process
for a long time, be vigilant about not introducing bugs, and be extra diligent
about writing tests.</p>
